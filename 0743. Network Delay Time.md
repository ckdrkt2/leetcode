```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        graph = defaultdict(dict)
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u][v] = w
        heap = [(0, k)]
        visited = {}
        while heap:
            time, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if u not in visited:
                visited[u] = time
                for v in graph[u]:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (visited[u] + graph[u][v], v))
        return max(visited.values()) if len(visited) == n else -1
```

time complexity: O(E + VlogV)       
space complexity: O(E + V)
