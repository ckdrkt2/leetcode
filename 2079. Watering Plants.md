```python
class Solution:
    def wateringPlants(self, plants: List[int], capacity: int) -> int:
        water = capacity; step = 0
        for i, p in enumerate(plants):
            if water >= p:
                water -= p
            else:
                step += i << 1
                water = capacity - p
        return step + i + 1
```
